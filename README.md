# Crime Analysis Task

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to analyzing crime data. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover trends and patterns in crime statistics.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with detailed visualizations.
- Insights and trends identified in crime data.
- Suggestions for actionable decisions based on analysis.

## Structure of the Notebook
- **Title**: Crime Analysis Task
- **Total Cells**: 47
